    "\n",
    "Within taxable credit research in FIG (the Fixed Income Group), understanding investment strategies and movements of other investors in the market is key to remaining competitive. \n",
    "As an analyst in FIG, one of the goals is understanding the investment strategy and movements of other investors in the market. More specifically, by looking at the holdings of investors who are dissimilar to Vanguard across time, we can find insights on how dissimilar market participants change their holdings to come up with  trends and themes for a specific time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you know that Vanguard has a certain amount of holdings in a specific stock X. Then you might want to look at how much of X do other institutional investors that you consider Vanguard's competitors, hold. You might also want to look at whether [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp#:~:text=Smart%20money%20is%20the%20capital,a%20track%20record%20of%20success) has changed its holdings in X recently, indicating their vision about X has changed. For instance, if a number of investors have significantly decreased their holdings in X recently, then that will be an indicator for you to study. You would need to understand whether there is a trend in reducing the holdings of X and why, to assess whether Vanguard would perform better if you changed the holdings in X too. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand other investorsâ€™ behaviors, we provide you with the 13F holdings data. Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and in this hackathon, you will be using them for clustering investors/holdings and identifying trends and deviations. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we define investors that are dissimilar to Vanguard? In our partnership with Columbia University for their Capstone project, the Columbia students used the 13F holdings data to apply unsupervised clustering in order to find clusters of investors that act similarly to each other. Through this process, the students found 2 major investor clusters: a cluster including Vanguard and those investors that behave similarly to vanguard, and a cluster including investors that behave dissimilarly to Vanguard. The students provided a list of around 50 investors that are different than Vanguard by this clustering mechanism. Their method is imperfect but provides a sensible list of investors that are different than Vanguard and that we consider smart investors. In order to look at the holdings of this list of investors, we will provide you with the list of around 50 investors that are characterized as acting differently than Vanguard. You will work with these investors to find interesting patterns and to assess the changes in their holdings throughout time.\n"
